A dependency occurs when one object invokes another object’s functionality in order to accomplish some specific task. This is a weaker relationship than an association, but still, any change to the dependent object may break functionality in the caller. A dependency is always a unidirectional relationship.

Dependencies vs Association in C++
There’s typically some confusion about what differentiates a dependency from an association.

In C++, associations are a relationship between two classes at the class level. That is, one class keeps a direct or indirect “link” to the associated class as a member. For example, a Doctor class has an array of pointers to its Patients as a member. You can always ask the Doctor who its patients are. The Driver class holds the id of the Car the driver object owns as an integer member. The Driver always knows what Car is associated with it.

Dependencies typically are not represented at the class level -- that is, the dependent object is not linked as a member. Rather, the dependent object is typically instantiated as needed (like opening a file to write data to), or passed into a function as a parameter (like std::ostream in the overloaded operator<< above).
