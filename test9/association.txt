Association

To qualify as an association, an object and another object must have the following relationship:

The associated object (member) is otherwise unrelated to the object (class)
The associated object (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time
The associated object (member) does not have its existence managed by the object (class)
The associated object (member) may or may not know about the existence of the object (class)

Unlike a composition or aggregation, where the part is a part of the whole object, in an association, the associated object is otherwise unrelated to the object. Just like an aggregation, the associated object can belong to multiple objects simultaneously, and isn’t managed by those objects. However, unlike an aggregation, where the relationship is always unidirectional, in an association, the relationship may be unidirectional or bidirectional (where the two objects are aware of each other).

The relationship between a doctors and patients is a great example of an association. The doctor clearly has a relationship with his patients, but conceptually it’s not a part/whole (object composition) relationship. A doctor can see many patients in a day, and a patient can see many doctors (perhaps they want a second opinion, or they are visiting different types of doctors). Neither of the object’s lifespans are tied to the other.

Composition vs aggregation vs association summary

Here’s a summary table to help you remember the difference between composition, aggregation, and association:

Property	        Composition	Aggregation	Association
Relationship type	Whole/part	Whole/part	Otherwise unrelated
Members can belong to multiple classes	No	Yes	Yes
Members existence managed by class	Yes	No	No
Directionality	Unidirectional	Unidirectional	Unidirectional or bidirectional
Relationship verb	Part-of	Has-a	Uses-a
